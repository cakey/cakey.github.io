# Hoplite

I'm going to review several mobile games. However, I'll be reviewing them from the perspective of how viable they would be as competitive mobile games. I'll be using my previous breakdown of mobile games as a framework, but I'm sure that framework will need adjusting as I become familiar with more games and their mechanics. I'm excited to find out where controls and game concepts work, and where they struggle.

Of course, not all the games I review are trying to be competitive - so think of these posts as less of a 'quality' review and more just me narrating my thoughts as I explore some of the games on the market.

I'll be focusing on iOS to start.

I noticed Hoplite after a brief google search for 'best iphone games'. (Hey - it worked!). I chose this game first as it seemed to have some similar ideas to a game I had been developing on my own (specifically turn based, on a small hex grid), so I'm curious to see how they've tackled mechanics and controls.

Let's start!

Loading up the game I'm greeting instantly by a tutorial. The graphics and music are basic, but have a certain style - DOOM meets DUNE
The tutorial instantly shows you it's turn based, played on a hex grid. I understand immediately that there's some abilities I can use, but they cost energy, there's also some concept of depth as you descend levels.

I'm introduced to an 'archer' obstacle, and realise this game is probably a puzzle game about using your skills to make your way to the stairs each level.

I've been playing for just 30 seconds - I'm impressed. Art style is clear, controls are intuitive - the hexes are just big enough to accurately press.

The tutorial introduces me to a few more mechanics, and I'm ready to play!

I've confirmed my hope that the controls and interface for a turn based, hex grid game can be intuitive.

OK, this game is awesome. (thanks google!).

It's a continuous puzzle game with various upgrades. So not only do you have to beat each level, but you need to consider the trade offs of various upgrade paths for later levels. I get the impression that this game will take many a run through to complete, as I optimise my strategies.

What I love about this game, is that it randomises the level on each play through, but each level as actually completely deterministic. I could plan all my moves in advance if I wanted to put the effort into it. That already makes this simple to pick up game very hard to master, which is important for a skill based game. As I play through this game, I come across more complex interactions than the basic abilities I'm given - I've learnt that I can get the enemy bomb thrower to kill one of the other enemies. This type of emergent behaviour is enormously satisfying to learn and then execute. It will definitely be something I look to integrate into other future games.

I ended up getting to depth 16 on my third run (after which it seemed to throw me back to the beginning) - after 2 deaths in the first level or two learning the mechanics. That was victory, but it seemed like the game could continue forever (each depth simply adds an additional enemy). It really was a great game.

I loved the upgrades affecting multiple levels, although so far, some of them seem far more powerful than others. It has some form of ranking, so I can try to beat my previous scores. Most importantly the controls and interface are very intuitive. The mechanics are well designed and interact with each other nicely. I get quite a chess vibe from the way you need to tackle each level.

Definitely worth the $2 I paid. I'm looking forward to trying new games!
