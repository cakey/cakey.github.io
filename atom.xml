    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Writing is Hard.</p>

<p>Seriously hard.</p>

<p>As someone who doesn&rsquo;t write nearly as much as I should it can be daunting to even begin.</p>

<p>The main issue, for me at least, is the persuit of perfection &ndash; or more accurately and less egotistically &ndash; the inability to leave things out and focus on the main story I&rsquo;m trying to tell. I don&rsquo;t suffer from a lack of ideas on interesing topics, but whenever I finally find time (and willpower!) to write, I&rsquo;m often overwhelmed by how much I want to say. Words start flowing, but that don&rsquo;t stop. Before long I have paragraph after paragraph with increasingly ambitious scope, and increasingly less value, as all that&rsquo;s left is a flurry of half formed ideas &ndash; none of which achieving the intended goal of engaging on or persuading a particular point.</p>

<p>As in many things, sometimes the most important and difficult steps are to start and then know when to stop. Then having something to show for it, however small.</p>

<p>So here we are.</p>
