I outlined in my article on the [rise of e-sports](/blog/2015/06/02/the-rise-of-esports)  that competitive video gaming is a huge, growing industry. Games are going mobile, and so will the competition.

Currently the market for real competitive mobile games in the vein of DOTA2, LOL, CS:GO and other similar titles is slim.
Blizzard released Hearthstone for mobile, it's different, but hugely popular due to a number of important characteristics that are necessary for a greta mobile game. Can a game as complex and deep as DOTA work on mobile? What would that look like?

To dominate the future mobile gaming market, a game will need fulfill a number of important criteria.

It's useful to start with what makes a mobile game fundamentally different to a traditional console or desktop game.
These realisations will directly effect the gameplay that you pursue.


 * Smaller Screen
    - You have to be much more conservative over how much information you can display.
        A game like civilization with its wealth of moving parts is difficult to translate to mobile because of this.
        Information needs to be clear, and accessible on a wide variety of devices.

 * Touch controls
    - A keyboard and mouse, and even a controller, give far more precise control.
        This means that certain game characteristics are out of reach. Designing a game around precision movement such as a first person shooter
        like Counter Strike, or a game where you need to rapidly control many various aspects, such as a real time
        strategy game like Starcraft, is more likely than not to give you a dissatisfactory feeling

 * Latency
    - 3G, 4G, and LTE networks are starting to have the bandwidth and response times to support a full real time game.
        I'm personally lucky enough to get ~50 ping on an LTE connection in San Francisco, but the realities are that
        games are all about appealing to the mass market, but domestically and abroad. Many places have far less reliable connections
        and latencies, and so building a game that is forgiving to these connections is important.

 * Usage habits
    - This may seem obvious, but people use phones differently to how they use PC and consoles.
        It's important to take this into account for something like game length. DOTA2 games last 30-60 minutes in general.
        This is a reasonable duration for those at their desk, but does not translate well to mobile. You want to consider and accommodate various
        usage scenarios such as commuting, where perhaps 5-10 minute sessions are more frequently the norm.

 * Performance & battery-life
    - Unlike console games, where game studios will try to get the most out of the hardware, on mobile there
        is a trade off between graphical and computational quality, and real aspects like battery life that can greatly frustrate the fans of your game


 * Connectivity, sensors and social integration.
    - Phones fundamentally have a different set of capabilities than desktops.
        Sensors such as GPS and accelerometers have enabled services such as Uber, Yelp and health apps to thrive on mobile.
        Equally ubiquitous cameras have enabled services like Instagram that just wouldn't have worked before smart phones.


 * Instant-on and notifications
    - Phones are much quicker to access, and on demand than traditional devices. Anything on your phone is available within a few seconds.
        This affects how games are presenting and marketed to players - The addictive notifications of games like Candy Crush and Clash of Clans
        just don't work on console or desktop, but as your phone is nearly always within reach, those notifications and completely shape usage.
        Instant notifications have changed how people communicate. Good or bad, it's something to keep in mind when considering how your game plays.


        A large aspect of gaming and mobile phone use is community.


With these differences in mind, we can start what aspects could lead to a thriving competitive mobile game.

 * Fun
    - Obvious, but worth stating due to its importance. Fundamentally your game needs to be fun if it wants to attract players. 'Fun' can come in
        many forms - addictive gratification as seen in currently popular mobile games. Engagement with friends and opponents. Skill based satisfaction
        from out playing your opponent. Random based variety. Ability to improve over time and tracking progress. Immersion into an alternative world.
        Whatever route you choose, the core game ideas need to be well executed and fun. Everything else is gravy.

 * Short duration games
    - 3-5 minute games would be best, to contest valuable phone time that would currently be spent on social media, news, and other short mobile games.

 * Slow paced game play, or turn based.
    - The impact of latency should be minimised and so mechanics that depend on rapid accurate responses that are common in games like CS:GO and DOTA
        are not possible.

 * Large discrete objects to interact with.
    - The less moving parts the game has, the easier to control and understand the current state of the game.
        Controllable aspects of the game should always be clear and forgiving to interact with.
        Hearthstone is a good example - it has very simple components that you can interact with - essentially just cards that you can play, with 1-4 targets
        on a slow manageable timeframe. The depth and gameplay is found in the decision making and allows the game itself to have a very
        easy to follow interface.

 * Easy to learn, hard to master.
    - Retention rates on mobile are notoriously low. In the short term the game most be accessible, obvious and fun. However, in the long term for a
        game to have staying power it needs tactical and strategical depth, where a player feels that they can always improve. People watch competitive
        video games, among other reasons, to watch people play the games they love at a much higher level than they are capable of.

 * Monetisation.
    - This can directly impact gameplay, and so is important to consider upfront. Games like Clash of Clans let you directly increase your power.
        Some games like Candy Crush, restrict playing time unless you pay. Other games like League of Legends and Hearthstone, restrict the variety and options available to you,
        unless you pay to unlock them. In most cases the gameplay is accessible without paying, but the length of time to achieve the equivalent of paying,
        mean that paying is strongly encouraged by the game.
        Valve have chosen a monetisation model for their games that strongly fits competitive and fair. In DOTA2 and CS:GO you cannot purchase increased power, and
        nothing is restricted without paying. The model is that you can buy 'cosmetics'. These are in game vanity items that change the look of your character. It has proven
        to be a very effective monetisation strategy, and is one that does not impact gameplay.

 * Out of game mindshare
    - A great aspect of a game like Hearthstone, with its customisable decks of cards. Is that you can be thinking about the game and optimising your chances of
        being successful, even when not playing what is the 'core' game. Being able to tinder and perfect something can be addictive, fun and rewarding and
        as a mobile phone is always within reach - this can provide instant gratification. This is similar to the appeal of playing fantasy sports games -
        there is no 'perfect' setup, and so you can always try to make improvements.

 * Social connectivity.
    - Mobile phones have cameras and microphones. This makes one click worldwide streaming very easy for the player to setup. It is far more engaging to watch a
        player when you can see and hear their emotions and thoughts as they play the game. The ability to integrate friends and community directly into the
        game experience has been undervalued.

 * Ranking and performance indicators.
    It's said that if you provide a metric, people will tend to focus on it. Explicit ranking of your skill in the game, from some sort of ranked ladder play
    and be both rewarding and addictive.

 * Observability.
    A competitive game truly takes off when it has a huge fan base. To establish this fan base, a game needs to be fun to watch as well as to play.
    This means that actions in the game need to be clear - unique animations, graphics and sounds for each action. The state of the game needs to be clearly accessible to viewers, and for newcomers there should be crude indications of who is winning, and how close to the victory conditions they are.
