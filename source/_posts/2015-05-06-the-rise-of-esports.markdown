**6 million dollars.**

This is the prize pool, after only 6 days, for The International 2015, Valve's Dota2's annual tournament.

25% of compendium sales goes towards the prize pool, an in-game item granting various effects. But really, this is about fans of the hugely popular Dota2 engaging with the game's marquee tournament. Where they get to see 16 teams of 5 players from around the world compete for historic money.

**The speed of growth has been immense.**

Valve announced their first international for summer 2011 when Dota2 was still in beta. The prize pool of $1.6m was so high compared to the tournaments in the already competitive DotA (the original game that was a mod for Warcraft 3), that some teams thought it was a scam.

In all years Valve started the prize pool at $1.6m, and all additional money was 25% of fan based purchases of in game items.

> **2011** : $1.6m<br>
> **2012** : $1.6m<br>
> **2013** : $2.9m (first year of the compendium)<br>
> **2014** : $10.9m

2015 looks on course to eclipse the already mammoth $11m from last year's tournament.

**But surely this is nothing compared to traditional sports?**

Let's see how things stack up.

[The Wimbledon 2014 singles event for Tennis had $9.6m each for women's and men's with a similar number of competing players.](http://www.wimbledon.com/pdf/Prize_Money_2014.pdf)

[Golf's 2014 PGA championship had a $10m prize pool for a similar number of players](http://www.sbnation.com/golf/2014/8/10/5989501/pga-championship-2014-purse-prize-money-payout-rory-mcilroy)

[Poker's biggest ever tournament (2006 World Series main event) clocked in at $82.5m, but with 100x the players](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_World_Series_of_Poker#Main_Event)

[Cricket's 2015 World Cup had $10.2, similar numbers of players](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Cricket_World_Cup#Prize_money)

What about one of the largest sporting events in the world? The FIFA World Cup.

[The FIFA 2014 World Cup comes in with a whopping $476m (ignoring the injury insurance). But, once you consider the per player numbers, we're down to an almost modest ~5x difference.](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/05/us-soccer-world-prizemoney-idUSBRE9B40QG20131205)

**So what?**

Of course, this 'analysis' is almost laughably rudimentary. What about sponsorships and broadcasting rights? Merchandise? Event tickets? Endorsements? What about events that are the culmination of a season, such as the Champions League, or the NFL's superbowl, or the NBA Playoffs, or any other number of huge sporting events. The list goes on.

But the point is to demonstrate the already massive scale of competitive gaming and gaming in general. Remember, Dota2 is just one game in a list of many. Take a look at Blizzards, Starcraft 2, or Riot's League of legends [(with 67m+ monthly players](http://www.polygon.com/2014/1/27/5350944/league-of-legends-has-27-million-daily-active-players) - twitter is at 302 million for comparison!) and you can see big tournaments for a huge audience. And if we take a closer look, not only are those other areas of revenue generation doing well in their own rights, but surely as the landscape matures will catch up.

**What's causing the growth?**

In some ways, the idea of competitive video games is an amusing concept. An entire industry predicated on escaping reality, is now rapidly re-engaging. From humble beginnings, video games are now the largest entertainment industry. Millions of fans leading to millions of dollars in prize pools are turning a niche area for the super dedicated playing for pride into a real culture starting to provide stable incomes (and sometimes huge payouts!) for a range of positions. Players, coaches, managers, sponsors, betting shops, broadcasters, event organizers, merchandise creators, developers all taking a slice of a rapidly growing pie.

Competitively, just a few years ago, video games felt much like the sports that started emerging in industrializing Britain. Increasing free time led to a number of games. Rules were gradually formalized, and competition became more fierce, leading to leagues and tournaments, all the way to now, and the commercial mammoths of modern sports.

But games won't follow that growth curve. We're in different times. We live In a time where the time for smartphones to reach a billion people was about 5 years. Where the Internet is ever more pervasive. In many ways gaming is more accessible than traditional sports. The games are often free to play, with modest system requirements. But that's not a fair comparison. You already have access to a community of millions of players for any ability level. Sports equipment can be expensive, but what about children relying on parents to take them to training every week. In many cases its simply not an option.

I'm not trying to suggest that esports are good or bad, or that you should enjoy playing or watching, simply that millions do. Esports are growing and they are growing fast.

The primary platform for viewing is twitch. Recently purchased by Amazon for a billion dollars. If you see their viewership figures it's easy to see why. [] However games themselves can be incredible at immersing the viewer, every statistic and analysis is right there in the game. The game client itself is a powerful viewing model that is barely replicates with traditional sports - trivially changing viewing angles, seeing the players perspective, rewinding, slow motion and interaction with other viewers. Watching the game in the client also allows much stronger engagement, prizes for witnessing various actions make the viewer feel more part of the action.

Ultimately when growing an audience, it comes down to engagement. Professional players, and personalities can broadcast themselves playing the game, often with commentary and other famous players. By live streaming and sharing content on YouTube they can make vast amounts of money from their impressive audience figures. For fans of the games, it's easy to understand why it is engaging. Watching a live stream of Messi, training in a Barcelona 5 a side would be hugely popular of course. But even if it were of lesser players, the skill difference at the top level, compared to amateur players is so vast, that these players would quickly gain a huge following and would likely lead to much more lucrative sponsorships. Indeed, some esport players [] are starting to be sponsored directly, simply for their huge loyal fan base.
