### **6 million dollars.**

This is the prize pool, after only 6 days, for The International 2015, Valve's Dota2's annual tournament. A game where at its core, 5 virtual magical characters bash 5 other virtual magical characters until victory. All watched by [20M](http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/29/5949773/dota-2-the-international-tournament-20-million-viewers) global viewers.

25% of compendium sales goes towards the prize pool, an in-game item granting various effects. But really, this is about fans of the hugely popular Dota2 engaging with the game's marquee tournament. Where they get to see the world's 16 best teams of 5 players from around the world compete for historic money.

**The speed of growth has been immense.**

Valve announced their first international for summer 2011 when Dota2 was still in beta. The prize pool of $1.6m was so high compared to the tournaments in the already competitive DotA (the original game that was a mod for Warcraft 3), that some teams thought it was a scam.

In all years Valve started the prize pool at $1.6m, and all additional money was 25% of fan based purchases of in game items.

> **2011** : $1.6m<br>
> **2012** : $1.6m<br>
> **2013** : $2.9m (first year of the compendium)<br>
> **2014** : $10.9m

2015 looks on course to eclipse the already mammoth $11m from last year's tournament.

### **But surely this is nothing compared to traditional sports?**

Let's see how things stack up.

The Wimbledon 2014 singles event for Tennis had [$9.6m](http://www.wimbledon.com/pdf/Prize_Money_2014.pdf) each for women's and men's with a similar number of competing players.

Golf's 2014 PGA championship had a [$10m](http://www.sbnation.com/golf/2014/8/10/5989501/pga-championship-2014-purse-prize-money-payout-rory-mcilroy) prize pool for a similar number of players

Poker's biggest ever tournament (2006 World Series main event) clocked in at [$82.5m](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_World_Series_of_Poker#Main_Event), but with 100x the players

Cricket's 2015 World Cup had [$10.2m](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Cricket_World_Cup#Prize_money), similar numbers of players

What about one of the largest sporting events in the world? The FIFA World Cup.

The FIFA 2014 World Cup comes in with a whopping [$476m](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/05/us-soccer-world-prizemoney-idUSBRE9B40QG20131205) (ignoring the injury insurance). But, once you consider the per player numbers, we're down to an almost modest ~5x difference.

### **So what?**

Of course, this 'analysis' is almost laughably rudimentary. What about sponsorships and broadcasting rights? Merchandise? Event tickets? Endorsements? What about events that are the culmination of a season, such as the Champions League, or the NFL's superbowl, or the NBA Playoffs, or any other number of huge sporting events. The list goes on.

But the point is to demonstrate the already massive scale of competitive gaming and gaming in general. Remember, Dota2 is just one game in a list of many. Take a look at Blizzard's Starcraft 2, or Riot's League of legends [(with 67m+ monthly players](http://www.polygon.com/2014/1/27/5350944/league-of-legends-has-27-million-daily-active-players) - twitter is at 302 million for comparison!) and you can see big tournaments for a huge audience. And if we take a closer look, not only are those other areas of revenue generation doing well in their own rights, but surely as the landscape matures will catch up.

### **What's causing the growth?**

**The game industry itself is huge.**

Global revenue of the video game industry was [$100B in 2014](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2614915)- nearly [3 times the movie industry](http://www.mpaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MPAA-Theatrical-Market-Statistics-2014.pdf). [Grand Theft Auto V made $1B in 3 days](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/20/gta-5-sales-hit-1-billion-in-three-days), while Minecraft was sold for [$2.5B](http://www.polygon.com/2014/9/15/6151559/microsoft-buys-minecraft-mojang) to Microsoft. Developers of games such as Clash of Clans and Candy Crush make an [obscene amount of money](http://venturebeat.com/2015/03/24/clash-of-clans-developer-supercells-revenues-tripled-in-2014/).

This doesn't necessarily all lead to more competitive gaming, but games being thoroughly main stream means that the concept of playing video games is hardly foreign.


**Twitch, YouTube and Social Media leads to huge engagement.**

Anyone can start posting content online and become wildly popular. In the gaming world, there are real celebrities making huge amounts of money from streaming themselves playing video games. The most notable example is [PewDiePie](https://twitter.com/pewdiepie). His 5.9 Million twitter followers puts him firmly with the names of biggest celebrities in the world. The failure of traditional media to capture his popularity merely highlights the shift in reporting that's happening. Compare Tiger Woods at [4.5M followers](https://twitter.com/TigerWoods). Beyonce at [14M](https://twitter.com/Beyonce). Kobe Bryant at [6.6M](https://twitter.com/kobebryant).Rafa Nadal at [7.9M](https://twitter.com/kobebryant). Leonardo DiCaprio with [12.8M](https://twitter.com/LeoDiCaprio). His [instagram](https://instagram.com/pewdiepie/) account has 4.2m followers. PewDiePie's youtube account has an utterly ridiculous [37 Million](https://www.youtube.com/user/PewDiePie) subscribers.

Of course, this is an extreme example, But it's an extreme example of a real underlying trend. Content is becoming distributed. It's easier than ever for individuals to reach huge audiences through platforms such as youtube and twitch. Last year, [Twitch broke 100M unique monthly viewers](http://www.twitch.tv/year/2014), leading Amazon to acquire them for [over $1 Billion](http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/25/amazon-will-buy-twitch-for-over-1-billion/). When you consider Netflix's Market Cap of [$35B](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:NFLX), and the relative size of the video game industry, then perhaps the price of twitch looks almost modest.

The huge viewership means that tournaments of the biggest games have a captive audience. Beyond The Summit, one of many Dota 2 studios providing content and streaming commentary for the game's competitive scene, is Twitch's [3rd most viewed channel](https://socialblade.com/twitch/user/beyondthesummit). Their popularity allows them to [host $300k tournaments](http://dota2.prizetrac.kr/thesummit3) with the best teams in the world. It's also very common for professional gamers to engage with their fans by streaming them playing the game in the regular, non competitive, modes - often with commentary. Subscriber and donation money supplements their income and helps keep them popular. They can easily engage with fans through Twitch chat, Reddit, twitter and other social media - and can show case their personality in casual games, while also showing of their skill in comparison to regular players. You can understand the popularity of such streams to their fans by likening it to Ronaldo or Messi broadcasting themselves playing 5-a-side with their friends while joking around.

**Gaming is mainstream.**

If the above didn't convince you, last year Twitch released an interesting study titled ["The New Face of Gamers"](http://blog.twitch.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/TheNewFaceofGamers.pdf). According to the study, 63% of Americans of *all ages* have played a game on a console, computer or mobile device in the last 60 days. Gamers are split evenly by gender, lead more social lives than non gamers, and are more highly educated. 59% of gamers had watched more livestreaming content than the previous year, with 36% preferring streaming to conventional TV. At the time of writing. Twitch was responsible for 1.8% of peak internet traffic. Gaming is mainstream.


### **OK, it's huge. Where are we heading?**

This is mostly speculation by me, but I think in many cases the trends will speak for themselves. Additionally, the examples will be bias in favor of Dota2 - as that's the area I'm most familiar with. Similar and often larger trends can be seen by other games such as League of Legends.

**We're going mobile.**

[Mobile game are overtaking console games.](http://fortune.com/2015/01/15/mobile-console-game-revenues-2015/). Traditionally, mobile games have been casual. Angry Birds, Candy Crush, and Clash of Clans rule the market. But I believe there's room for more competitive, multiplayer, skill based games, in the mould of Dota2, Starcraft and Coutner Strike. Latencies and bandwidth are increasingly becoming amenable to such types of gaming, and I believe that it's possible to shrink down a game, and simplify the controls, such that the teamwork and strategic awareness - which is what really makes the most competitive games thrive - is brought out.

Heartstone was recently released on smart phones, a digital card game made by Blizzard.

 The game was already thriving, with tournaments and large Twitch viewer ship. Professional player 'TrumpSC' peaked at [77k](http://www.goldper10.com/stat/1530-hearthstone-streamer-stats-march-april-2015.html) concurrent viewers during April. The turn based nature of the game, with few moving parts relative to other games, makes it perfect for mobile - and will see the game grow beyond the [30M](http://www.polygon.com/2015/5/5/8554265/hearthstone-player-count-hits-30-million) players it already commands.

 Allowing regular gamers, a deep strategic multiplayer game, during spare moments of the day such as commuting is a hugely untapped market.
